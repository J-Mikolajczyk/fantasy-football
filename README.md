# Fantasy Football Using AI

## Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques for projecting Fantasy Football points.

## Methodology

- The project aims to use statistics from year n and corresponding fantasy points from year n+1 to develop a predictive model.
- Subsequently, this model will be used to forecast fantasy points for the year 2023 using statistics from the year 2022.
- The main objective is to compare the projected fantasy points generated by the model with the actual points scored in 2023.
